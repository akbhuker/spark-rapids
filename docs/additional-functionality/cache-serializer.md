# RAPIDS Cache Serializer  
  Apache Spark provides an important feature to cache intermediate data and provide
  significant performance improvement while running multiple queries on the same data. There
  are two ways to cache a Dataframe or a DataSet i.e. call `persist(storageLevel)` or
  `cache()`. Calling `cache()` is the same as calling `persist(MEMORY_AND_DISK)`. There are
  many articles online that can be read about caching and its benefits as well as when to
  cache but as a rule of thumb we should identify the Dataframe that is being reused in a
  Spark Application and cache it. Even if the system memory isn't big enough, Spark will
  utilize disk space to spill over. To read more about what storage levels are available look
  at `StorageLevel.scala` in Spark.

  Starting in Spark 3.1.1 users can add their own cache serializer, if they desire, by
  setting the `spark.sql.cache.serializer` configuration. This is a static configuration
  that is set once for the duration of a Spark application which means that you can only set the conf
  before starting a Spark application and cannot be changed for that application's Spark
  session.

  RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark version 0.4+ has the `ParquetCachedBatchSerializer`
  that is optimized to run on the GPU and uses Parquet to compress data before caching it.
  ParquetCachedBatchSerializer can be used independent of what the value of
  `spark.rapids.sql.enabled` is. If it is set to true then the Parquet compression will run
  on the GPU if possible, and importantly
  `spark.sql.inMemoryColumnarStorage.enableVectorizedReader` will not be honored as the GPU
  data is always read in as columnar. If `spark.rapids.sql.enabled` is set to false
  the cached objects will still be compressed on the CPU as a part of the caching process.
  
  Please note that ParquetCachedBatchSerializer doesn't support negative decimal scale, so if 
  `spark.sql.legacy.allowNegativeScaleOfDecimal` is set to true ParquetCachedBatchSerializer
  should not be used.  Using the serializer with negative decimal scales will generate
  an error at runtime.

  To use this serializer please run Spark with the following conf.
  ```
  spark-shell --conf spark.sql.cache.serializer=com.nvidia.spark.ParquetCachedBatchSerializer"
  ```

 
##          Supported Types                       
 
 All types are supported on the CPU, on the GPU, ArrayType, MapType and BinaryType are not
 supported. If an unsupported type is encountered the Rapids Accelerator for Apache Spark will fall 
 back to using the CPU for caching.
